# Jetpack compose sample

Compose has deep learning curve. Thinking in Compose can be little bit difficult for the developers who not yet started with Compose and coding in exiting View based apps. I have started with List.

Offcource, there are bunch of tutorial, video, codelab, pathways on Andorid developer docs to start with.

Here in this example, I have maintained incremental branches names from 01, 02,.. as I go further learning the compose...
1. 01basiclist
2. 02basiclist_item_click
3. 03basiclist_view_update

Hope this will be useful!
